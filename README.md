> [!NOTE]
> I've been using Ansible for a while to configure these routines, but after
> some time, I realized that it was time-consuming to maintain
> this configuration using Ansible. Instead, I've found `chezmoi` as a
> lightweight alternative, but with the constraint of managing only
> configuration files. I am planning to gradually transition to `chezmoi` in
> the coming weeks and sync my workstation (Ubuntu 24.04) and Mac (MBP 14)
> configurations with this single tool.
